Mesh types:
   - Cartesian (done).
   - Unstructured, extruded (done).
   - Unstructured, general (not done, probably not worth it).

Transport methods:

   - SN (not done).

Calculation modes:
   - Steady state, without source (done for diffusion method, next for SN).
   - Steady state, with source (not done, probably not worth it).
   - Transient (not done).
   - Depletion (not done).

Parallel schemes:
   - Domain decomposition + MPI (not done).
   - GPU (not done).
   - OpenMP multithreading (not done, probably not worth it).
