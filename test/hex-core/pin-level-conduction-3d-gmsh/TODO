- Perfect gap conductance between materials (not conservative).
- Implement convection boundary conditions:
   - Outer boundary: T = 298 K, h = 5 [W/mÂ²K].
- Shutdown rods: adiabatic (q = 0) boundary conditions. Shutdown-rod tubes are filled with air!
- Heat pipes in (beryllium) reflector region: adiabatic (q = 0) boundary conditions.
- Heat pipes in the active region: convection boundary conditions (see OpenFOAM paper).
- Pure-graphite reflector for now.

Check method order (initialize, finalize, etc).
Add a default mesh boundary.
Switch to zero-based indexing for boundary conditions.
Clean up loop index variable names.
Clean up physical variable names.
Clean up i++ and ++i in input functions.
Add an option to only preprocess.
Add nodal meshes for all solvers.
Clean up the read() method for the heat-conduction solver.
Clean up the output::print() functions.
