- Perfect gap conductance between materials (not conservative).
- Implement convection boundary conditions:
   - Outer boundary: T = 298 K, h = 5 [W/mÂ²K].
- Shutdown rods: adiabatic (q = 0) boundary conditions. Shutdown-rod tubes are filled with air!
- Heat pipes in (beryllium) reflector region: adiabatic (q = 0) boundary conditions.
- Heat pipes in the active region: convection boundary conditions (see OpenFOAM paper).
- Pure-graphite reflector for now.
